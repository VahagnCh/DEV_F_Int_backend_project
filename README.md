API that allows searching for people based on their skills for hiring purposes.

Pedrito Sola is introverted but very good at public speaking. He wants to earn some money by leveraging his skills, so he decides to create an account on 'Tinder for Skills,' where he charges $30 USD per hour of work.

Rappi is a company looking for someone to make commercials, with good public speaking skills, so they search the 'Tinder for Skills' platform and find Pedrito Sola.

They contact him and agree to work for 6 hours to record a commercial. Rappi needs to provide Pedrito with a quote.

‘Tinder for Skills’ asks Rappi for an advance payment so that Pedrito Sola can show up at the Justo facilities to start working. Once the advance is made, Pedrito Sola is notified of the day, time, and place where he needs to be.

Once the commercial is finished, both Pedrito Sola and Rappi confirm that the service is completed in the app. Rappi must then complete the payment and rate Pedrito Sola’s service.
